# Zero

Accidents happen anywhere and at any time, and if people were notified of the incident, they could avoid traveling that route or visiting that location. For that reason, we created ZERO. 

Upon seeing any dangerous settings, the user can create an alert and mark their current location, and once the alert has been created, anyone nearby will be notified of that alert, making those alerted more aware of their surroundings. 

To prevent false alerts, each alert can be rated as legit or fake by the users nearby who also passes by that same area. Through these ratings, the user posting the alert will have a reliability percentage depending on how legit their alerts are. Users can also comment on alerts to add more information about the incident if needed.
